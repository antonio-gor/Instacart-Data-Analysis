## Data Processing

**The Instacart Online Grocery Shopping Dataset 2017**\*

From Instacart's data release post:

>Note that this dataset includes orders from many different retailers and is a heavily biased subset of Instacartâ€™s production data, and so is not a representative sample of our products, users or their purchasing behavior.

This is a relational dataset split into six CSV files. The dataset contains anonymized data of ~206k Instacart users and 3 million orders.
